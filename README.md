# Worklog Suggestions

Jira Copilot provides a list of suggested worklogs categorized by days. Here's how to interpret the color codes:

* Purple: Suggested worklogs for tasks where you are the assignee.
* Green: Worklogs that are already logged in Jira. If no time is specified, they are associated with the suggested worklog above. If time is specified, they are independent worklogs.
* Blue: Suggested worklogs for tasks where you have left comments.
