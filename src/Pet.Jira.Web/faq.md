#### What is the purpose of this automation?
The purpose of this automation is to log time for Jira issues. The calculations provided are advisory and approximate.

#### Who is this for?
This automation is designed for the development team. It primarily takes into account the dev workflow and is tailored to changes in task statuses where the employee is responsible.

#### What time zone is used for time fields?
The time zone used for time fields is based on the employee's time zone in Jira.

#### Is it possible to log arbitrary time?
Yes, it is possible to log arbitrary time. However, please note that the time calculation provided is purely advisory.

#### Where is the information I entered stored?
The information you enter is not stored in a centralized permanent database. Instead, it is stored locally in your browser's storage.

#### How is the logged time associated with a task?
Currently, the logged time is associated with the time of status change. If there is a mismatch between the time of status change and the time of logging, the association does not occur.

#### How do I remove worklog?
You can remove worklog through the Jira user interface (UI).

#### I enter the correct username and password, but I get an error. Why?
Sometimes Jira may require a captcha after a certain number of login errors. In such cases, you will need to login via the Jira UI to resolve the captcha.
